Code accompanying master's thesis
=================================

The code contained in this repository accompanies the physics master's thesis by Raphael Ehmann titled "A machine learning approach to quantum thermodynamcis".

The file named Unitary_solution.jl solves a differential equation system. The solution of this computation is needed for some of the other files. The files Variables.jl, UnitaryQTable.jl, Rewardfield.jl, and LocationsAndActions.jl contain modules, which aid Agent.jl.
